# JSON Schema

> . JSON Schema is an [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04#:~:text=JSON%20Schema%20is%20a%20JSON,interaction%20control%20of%20JSON%20data.) providing a format for what JSON data is required for a given application and how to interact with it. Applying such standards for a JSON document lets you enforce consistency and data validity across similar JSON data.
